An AI which learnt to play Nim, an ancient Chinese game, through Reinforcement Learning(Q-learning algorithm)
and an epsilon-greedy approach.
Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing (or "nimming") objects from piles. 
On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come
from the same pile. 
On this version of the game, the goal is to avoid taking the last object.
