This project is an implementation in python of an algorithm for assessing the quality of an image called SSIM (structural similarity) index.
It was introduced in a famous paper from 2004 titled "Image quality assessment: from error visibility to structural similarity". 

We made a presentation on the paper and re-emplemented the algorithm to answer 3 questions:
1. What is the best AI image upscaling server?
2. Downscaling and upscaling an image by a fixed ratio, how does the quality change as I do this hundreds of times?
3. Downscaling and upscaling an image a fixed number of times, how does the quality of an image change as a function of how much it is downscaled each time (100%, 99.9%, 99.8%...0.1%)?

In this folder I'll post the 3 scripts we made to answer these questions. 

We used pandas, scikit-image, matplotlib and we worked with the Remini API 

Hope you enjoy the code ;)
